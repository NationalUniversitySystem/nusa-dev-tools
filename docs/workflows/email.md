## Steps
The following steps are based on the [Email Project Schedule Breakdown](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-YDvSdWL7-4Rg9_A_a0Sr51ORVJpds756IwNvv0iFI4/edit#gid=0):
- Use copy deck from Copy team member that should be tagged for dev in Jig.
- Choose affiliate and type of HTML template that is needed or referenced job # on Google Drive/Workamajig. References for templates can be found in the [Email Templates Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iidUG-57gmt0lOa988mLr1Ilt1ThcGN29fJQzQr54yc/edit#gid=1872926667).
- Email template development:
	- Add template as new folder in the [email-dev](https://github.com/NationalUniversitySystem/email-dev) repo.
	- Add/Delete what snippets will be needed base on copy.
	- Add the copy from the deck into the correct snippets within the HTML template.
	- Update HTML email template to add images if necessary. Keep images in repo using relative paths. Some commonly used images are in the root folder in `/images/`.
	- Commit changes with the message being prefixed with the Jig job number.
	- **Notes / Tips:**
		- Wait until review rounds are completed by all reviewers to make template updates, because sometimes decisions are changed in the process.
		- If single file, use `index.html` in the email project's folder to share shorter URL.
		- If multiple files being delivered, exclude Jig job in file name to make the URL less redundant, use only part name (e.g. `webinar.html` and `webinar-reminder.html`).
		- Optional: update the `index.html` file in the root of the [email-dev](https://github.com/NationalUniversitySystem/email-dev) repo for easy access.
		- The [email-dev](https://github.com/NationalUniversitySystem/email-dev) builds take ~30 seconds max and are hosted at [nus-email-dev.netlify.app](https://nus-email-dev.netlify.app/).
